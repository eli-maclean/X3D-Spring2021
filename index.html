                                            Human anatomical models have a high level of complexity due to 
                                            functional components of human anatomy and structural components of human anatomy.
                                            The power of web3d programing on the internet can be used to deploy more complex 
                                            and efficient training tools for medial students. 
                                            Specifically, we are employing the X3D ISO standard in the development.

                                            Problem-based instruction is an active learning instructional practice that requires students to think rationally and critically in order to generate reasonable solutions to problem-based scenarios <a href="https://academy.pubs.asha.org/2019/06/problem-based-learning-in-speech-language-pathology-graduate-education/">[1]</a>.Problem-based learning in addition to lecture and gross anatomy lab-based instruction helps teach students the content knowledge and critical thinking skills needed for clinical practice.

                                            The realities of Covid-19 have necessitated physical barriers to learning and created an increased focus on ways to effectively leverage technology to deliver high-quality instruction remotely. Further complicating the situation, many students find themselves and their families in difficult circumstances, particularly financially, and they might not be able to purchase virtual learning tools. Likewise, institutions of higher learning are facing funding woes and uncertainty, so most are not likely to spend potentially tens of thousands of dollars on high end anatomy and physiology instructional technology. In response to this we developed an open-source web-based application as a cost effective solution for remote learning.
